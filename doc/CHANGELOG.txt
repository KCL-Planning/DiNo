3.02: Bug fix release (2015/05/04)

[FIX] fixed issue about TIL/TIF check (now check the start state)
[FIX] fixed issue within the “time-passing” rule (now the chain is (1) increase TIME variable, (2) check TIL/TIF, (3) check events/processes


3.01: Bug fix release (2015/04/29)

[FIX] Fixed an issue in comparing Real_type variable (eg, PDDL function type) 
against TIME_type (ie, the type of variable TIME). This is due to the 
comparison of two different types that the mu_real library does not support 
well. We fixed this issue by forcing Durative-action clock variable to be 
TIME_type rather than Real_type. As a drawback DiNo will spend more byte 
in the state encoding, but the comparison will be safe.

[FIX] The DAs_violate_duration() function - that allows DiNo to check 
whether the duration of a Durative Action has been violated or not - 
presents a bug when the duration is a conjunction of constraints (eg, 
?duration >= 0 and ?duration <=100). Indeed, this function has been 
intended to prune a DA that exceeds its duration bounds expressed as open 
intervals or exact value (eg, ?duration < 100 ; ?duration = 100; 
?duration <= 100), but it cannot deal with *closed* invervals. This is an
interesting issue to be included in the next version of DiNo to improve 
the performances. Actually, the bug has been fided by disabling the check 
on DA having a duration constraint that is a closed interval.
 
[FIX] Print function for real type (used with the PUT command for debug purposes).

[FIX] "Error" states, detected as invariant violations during the exploration, are
now more clearly marked as "invalid" states, since invariants can be used in
DiNo to prune the exploration graph, not only to detect error states.
